        I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science from
        Chandigarh University. Following my graduation, I joined Toddle as a
        Frontend Developer Intern, where I worked for nearly one year. During my
        time at Toddle, I utilized technologies such as React.js, Redux, GraphQL
        Apollo, SCSS, and moment.js.

        Currently, I am employed at Dreamsync, an early-stage startup
        specializing in AI dubbing for regional Indian languages. At Dreamsync,
        I am involved in projects utilizing Next.js, React.js, Redux, Tailwind
        CSS, and Shadcn. I have contributed to developing innovative solutions
        and enhancing user experiences through these technologies. My role at
        Dreamsync has allowed me to deepen my expertise in frontend development
        and collaborate on cutting-edge AI-driven projects.
